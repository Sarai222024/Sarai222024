## üöÄExperiences

As a systems engineering student, my interest in technology has led me to explore and acquire knowledge in various tools and programming languages. I am learning technologies such as Java, Python, C++, and MySQL, which has allowed me to develop efficient and well-structured projects. I am excited about the multiple opportunities that the field of programming offers, and I am committed to continuing to grow in this area. My goal is to integrate my backend programming knowledge with database skills to create robust and complete applications.

I am always open to learning and facing new challenges; I am passionate about technology and consider myself a persevering person.
